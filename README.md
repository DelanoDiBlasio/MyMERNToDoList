This is a todo list application with JWT authentication.

Firstly, cd into frontend directory and use command npm install to recieve all dependencies.

Secondly,  cd into backend directory and use command npm install to install all the dependencies for the backend.

Thirdly, cd into the frontend directory and run the command npm start to see the project on http://localhost:3000

I also learnt abit of redux to make this more efficient which I learnt online.

Unfortunately the app is slow so give it time to load.
